# Decision Log

- 2026-02-10: Initialized Codex agent environment with docs-first workflow and pnpm monorepo direction.
- 2026-02-10: Selected custom monorepo bootstrap (`apps/desktop`) instead of single-package scaffold.
- 2026-02-10: Standardized pane layout on `react-grid-layout` for drag/resize and zoom overlay behavior.
- 2026-02-10: Implemented PTY output streaming through Tauri Channels with reader loop on tokio blocking runtime pool.
- 2026-02-10: Chose Tauri plugin-store JSON persistence for session snapshots and quick-launch blueprints.
- 2026-02-10: Captured "last command" at frontend Enter-submit boundary rather than shell-history scraping.

## [2026-02-11] - Test Stack and CI Baseline
**Context:** The core orchestrator features are in place but lacked automated regression coverage and branch protection checks.
**Decision:** Standardize frontend tests on Vitest + Testing Library and add GitHub Actions CI jobs for frontend and Rust validation.
**Rationale:** This balances fast iteration on UI/store logic with direct backend command validation before feature expansion.
**Consequences:** CI now requires test dependencies and stable npm registry access; lockfile and dependency health become part of delivery quality.
**Alternatives Considered:** Playwright-heavy only, Rust-only testing, and local-only checks without CI.

## [2026-02-11] - PTY Error and Lifecycle Hardening
**Context:** PTY command paths needed clearer failure surfaces and stronger pane lifecycle guarantees under concurrent actions.
**Decision:** Add categorized backend error formatting, bounded PTY read chunk size, duplicate spawn race guard, and guaranteed async pane cleanup.
**Rationale:** Reduces ambiguous failures and prevents stale pane registry state under high churn.
**Consequences:** Slightly more backend complexity, but simpler debugging and safer command behavior.
**Alternatives Considered:** Keep ad-hoc string errors and rely on UI-side retries only.
